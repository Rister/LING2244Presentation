Objectives:
	Detail the impact of mother's singing on young children
	Not a research work itself, instead a discussion work
	<>

Introduction:
	An investigation into:
		The impact of singing on infant development and emotional state
		The role of mothers as a mentor for children both through the use of music and to teach music

Research Questions:
	(1)What kinds of songs are usually sung to infants?
	(2)When are infants usually sung to?
	(3)What mannerisms or methods are used when singing to infants, and how does this differ from non-infant-directed singing?
	(4)How do infants respond to singing?
	(5)How does infants' ability to detect changes in musical properties differ from adults' ability to do the same?
	(6)What stages do children go through in learning to sing?
	(7)Are all mothers singing mentors?

	(7)Yes, in a sense. While not always using vocal interaction (deaf family), sign language and other gestures towards the child are more rythmic than when interacting with adults
	Children (especially infants) acquire music similarly to how they acquire language
		<very early age> can notice changes in musical properties in both western and non-western music, western children quickly lose this ability
