\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}
	An investigation into:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The impact of singing on infant development and emotional state
		\item The role of mothers as a mentor for children both through the use of music and to teach music
		\item Infants' perception of music and ability to detect changes in musical properties
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Literature Review}
\begin{frame}
	% Contrast studies of the informal singing of adults with the studies investigating maternal singing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Studies of informal singing
		\item Studies of Maternal Singing
		\item Studies of 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Objectives}
\begin{frame}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Preliminary review of the maternal activity of singing to a child
		\item Observe and analyze the emotional response of the child to maternal song
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Research Questions}
\begin{frame}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What kinds of songs are usually sung to infants?
		\item When are infants usually sung to?
		\item What mannerisms or methods are used when singing to infants, and how does this differ from non-infant-directed singing?
		\item How do infants respond to singing?
		\item To what extent can infants detect changes in musical properties?
		\item What stages do children go through in learning to sing?
		\item Are all mothers singing mentors?
	\end{enumerate}

	\frametitle{What kinds of songs are usually sung to infants?}
	It depends on the culture:\\

	Developing nations: lullabies.\\
	Developed nations: play songs, occasionally lullabies.

\subsection*{Infant Response}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{How do infants respond to singing?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Attentiveness: infants listen longer to maternal singing than non-maternal singing.
		\item Singing modulates stress arousal (alertness).
	\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{How do infants respond to singing?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Attentiveness: infants listen longer to maternal singing than non-maternal singing.
		\item Singing modulates stress arousal (alertness).
		\item Calms down distressed infant.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection*{Ability to Detect Musical Changes}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{To what extent can infants detect changes in musical properties?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Infants can detect a small pitch change in a single note of melody.
		\item Sometimes they can detect interval changes when the melodic contour stays the same.
		\item Infants can detect changes in rhythmic grouping even when tempo changes are happening.
		\item Infants more accurately detected timing changes in songs with duple meter than with triple meter.
		\item With ambiuous meter: movement affects what infants recognise as familiar.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{To what extent can infants detect changes in musical properties?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Young infants ``learn'' to detect changes in their culture's music similarly to how they learn to detect sounds in their native language.
		\item Adults can readily detect small pitch changes in songs based on a familiar major scale, but not on an unfamiliar scale.

		\item Adults can readily detect small pitch changes in songs based on a familiar major scale, but not on an unfamiliar scale.
		\item 9-month-old infants detect small pitch changes in both song types.
		\item 6-month-old infants detected changes in meter in both simple-metered and complex-metered Balkan music; adults only in simple-metered music.

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In developing countries, primarily lullabies; in developed countries, primarily play songs and occasionally lullabies.
		\item Primarily when at play, secondarily during routines (diaper changing, feeding, etc.).
		\item Often smiling, gives a "happier" sound/conveys happiness; increased usage of gestures; %--TODO: finish this one--
		\item Infant stress is modulated, happy infants become happier, distressed infants become happy.
		\item %<>
		\item %<>
		\item Yes, in a sense. While not always using vocal interaction (deaf family), sign language and other gestures towards the child are more rythmic than when interacting with adults.
